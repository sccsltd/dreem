## Community Leads (Dreem owner forums / Discord)

Salvaged pointers from other Dreem 2 owners working the same orphaned-device problem. The durable findings independently corroborate this project's conclusions (raw EEG is processed on-headband, not streamed over BLE; the cloud/report path is dead but the device still stores data locally).

- Archived Dreem support pages via Wayback: http://web.archive.org/web/20211207034635/https://support.dreem.com/hc/en-us
- 2017 Dreem whitepaper (originally at `s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rythm/rythm-dreem-whitepaper.pdf`) — recover via the Wayback Machine.
- A community "modified APK" reportedly re-enables account creation, Wi-Fi setup, and firmware update against the dead backend, so sleep tracking still works locally (reports remain blocked by lost server permissions). Shared owner-to-owner on Discord; not vendored here.
- Reported lead worth verifying: with the modified APK connected, night data is said to be readable "from the root folder on the phone," and the headband still reaches its own (separate) firmware-update server. In-app CSV/OSCAR export is broken.

## Local Outcome

These references were checked for extraction clues. They helped with hardware and protocol orientation, but did not provide a public path to stored raw Dreem 2 `.h5` recovery.
